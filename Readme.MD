A Pokemon game made with PyGame.

We will try to acheive persistence importing and exporting data.

Each Pokemon has his type(fire, water, plant).
There will be attacks of each type (fire, water, plant), and different levels(1,2,3).
Depending on the level the attacks will be safer but less powerful, in the highest level attacks we can penalyze more or less in a random way.
Depending of the opponent type, the attacks can have buff damage.
